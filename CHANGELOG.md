# Changelog

### 1.0.0
- Basic speedrun timing functionality
- Start offset support
- Read run from split file (file currently locked to "run.msf" in directory where executable is stored)
- If completed run is a PB, save run data to split file
- Change timer color according to run status (not sure if this all works properly)
- Spacebar to start, split, stop; Enter to pause/unpause; R key to reset timer
- Convert time to 30fps values on stop (non-configurable)
- Doesnt crash when you resize the window vertically (yay!) (horizontal resizes probably still bad)
